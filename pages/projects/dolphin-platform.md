I maintained the project as part of my job when working for the company Canoo. After leaving the company the company the project stopped and I sucessfully forked it to rico.

{% include elements/warning-block.html text="Dolphin Platform is not longer in active development. But since it is an open source project you can still find all sources and documentation online. Furher development in a fork as by providing pull request is always welcome. With rico a fork of the Dolphin Platform exists and is still in active development." %}
