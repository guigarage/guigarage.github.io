GridFX is a JavaFX component to visualize data in a grid.

Since several years GridFX is part of the [ControlsFX project](https://github.com/controlsfx/controlsfx). The component was renamed to `org.controlsfx.control.GridView` to fit the naming convention of ControlsFX.

{% include elements/warning-block.html text="The GridFX project is not longer in active development. But since it is an open source project you can still find all sources and documentation online. Furher development in a fork as by providing pull request is always welcome." %}
