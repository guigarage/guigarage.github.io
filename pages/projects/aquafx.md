Like [AeroFX]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/projects/aerofx.md %}) and [Flatter]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/projects/flatter.md %}) AquaFX is an open source skin for JavaFX. AquaFX contains skins and style for all controls that are part of JavaFX to provide a native like look and feel on Mac OS. AquaFX was developed as a bachelor thesis by Claudine Zillmann.
