JGrid is a swing component to visualize data in a grid. Here are 2 screenshotsÂ from JGrid sample applications:

Next to the JGrid I created a grid component with even more features for JavaFX. You can find everything of the GridFX [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/projects/gridfx.md %}).

{% include elements/warning-block.html text="The JGrid project is not longer in active development. But since it is an open source project you can still find all sources and documentation online. Furher development in a fork as by providing pull request is always welcome." %}
