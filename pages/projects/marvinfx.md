MarvinFX has the goal to easily test JavaFX controls and scenes with a special attention on properties. When I started with JavaFX development there was no really usable testing framework for JavaFX and therefore I started to write my own small framework.

{% include elements/warning-block.html text="MarvinFX is not longer in active development. But since it is an open source project you can still find all sources and documentation online. Furher development in a fork as by providing pull request is always welcome." %}
