If you are new to JavaFX there are some good resources to start learning about all the cool features of JavaFX and how the APIs should be used to create applications. This page will give an overview to all resources that I can recommend to any developer who wants to learn JavaFX.

## JavaFX RefCard

Together with DZone and Michael Heinrichs I created a JavaFX 8 Refaced that can be found [here](https://dzone.com/refcardz/javafx-8-1?utm_content=buffer8f1dd&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer):

## JavaFX Online Tutorial

Sadly you can't find that many JavaFX beginner tutorials online. In addition some tutorials are old and target a JavaFX Version &lt; 2.x that isn't compatible to JavaFX 8. Here is a list of good JavaFX tutorials that are up to date and can be used as a good starting point:</p>

* [code.makery.ch tutorial](http://code.makery.ch/java/javafx-8-tutorial-intro/)
* [Oracle tutorials](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javase-clienttechnologies.html)

## Online Course

I created a 2 hour online course for [Parleys](https://www.parleys.com/course/javafx-beginners). The "JavaFX for beginners" course gives an overview to the JavaFX APIs and shows you can create your first applications by using the Scene Graph, controls, layout panes, CSS and FXML. For a beginner this is a good point to get a quick overview of JavaFX and a start creating your first small applications.

## JavaFX Training

Each year I offer JavaFX related trainings at the [JFX Days](https://www.jfx-days.com) in Zurich.

## JavaFX Books

Next to [my JavaFX book]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/mastering-javafx-controls.md %}) there are some other good books that can be used to learn the basics of JavaFX. Currently there are no experts book on the market and therefore all JavaFX books are good for beginners. I would prefer the following ones:

* [JavaFX 8: Introduction by Example](http://www.amazon.com/JavaFX-Introduction-Example-Carl-Dea/dp/1430264608/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1425314839&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=JavaFX)
* [Pro JavaFX 8](http://www.amazon.com/Pro-JavaFX-Definitive-Building-Embedded/dp/1430265744/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1425314839&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=JavaFX)
* [Mastering JavaFX 8 Controls](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-JavaFX-Controls-Oracle-Press/dp/0071833773/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_z)
