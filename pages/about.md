Hi,  
my name is Hendrik Ebbers and this is my website about ui development in Java. Here I write about my open source projects and explorations of creating cool, fast and well behaving user-interfaces.

## About me

I'm a co-founder of Karakun AG and live in Dortmund, Germany. I'm the founder and leader of the Java User Group Dortmund and give talks and presentations in user groups and conferences. My JavaFX book “Mastering JavaFX 8 Controls” was released in 2014 by Oracle press. I'm a JavaOne Rockstar, JSR expert group member and Java Champion. I'm a member of the AdoptOpenJDK TSC.
