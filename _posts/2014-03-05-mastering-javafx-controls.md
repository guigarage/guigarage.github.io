In summer my first JavaFX book will be released and I created a first info page about the book. I will add additional informations the next days and hopefully there will be a free downloadable chapter in the next weeks. I plan to add all sources and demo applications that are mentioned in the book to the page.

You can find all information here: [Mastering JavaFX Controls]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/mastering-javafx-controls.md %})
