Since a few minutes [GridFX]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-11-13-jgridfx-first-demo %}) is official part of [JFXtras](http://jfxtras.org). I will remove all sources from the old github repository in a little while. Thanks to everyone who helped me to go this way. So if you want to try GridFX just check out JFXtras [here](https://github.com/JFXtras/jfxtras-labs) or wait for the next release.
