Here is a preview of my new Swing component. It´s a simple rating component that supports different renderers. There are actually some properties like the gap between the elements and a default star renderer.

The first version is still in development and there is no documentation at the moment. Even the star icons need a redesign but I think it´s time for a first demo. Everyone who is interested can check out the source code at [https://code.google.com/p/jrating/](https://code.google.com/p/jrating/).
