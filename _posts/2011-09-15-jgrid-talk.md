Here is the first JGrid presentation. I gave the talk this week at the [NetBeans Platform Certified Training course](http://edu.netbeans.org/courses/nbplatform-certified-training/) in MÃ¼nster:

If you are interested in the GarageTunes demo I'm showing in the talk you can check out the sources at [google code](https://code.google.com/p/jgrid/). I will create a webstart demo later.
You can download the presentation [here](/assets/downloads/jgrid/jgrid-session.pdf).
