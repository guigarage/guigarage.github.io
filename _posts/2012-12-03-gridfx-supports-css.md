I added CSS support to [GridFX]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-11-29-gridfx-is-moving-forward %}). There are five properties that can be styled by CSS at the moment:

* `-fx-vertical-cell-spacing` - vertical spacing between two cells (double)
* `-fx-horizontal-cell-spacing` - horizontal spacing between two cells (double)
* `-fx-cell-height` - height of a cell (double)
* `-fx-cell-width` - width of a cell (double)
* `-fx-horizontal-alignment` - horizontal alignment of all cells (LEFT,CENTER, or RIGHT)

Stay tuned for the upcoming "Custom Controls" post that will handle CSS support.
