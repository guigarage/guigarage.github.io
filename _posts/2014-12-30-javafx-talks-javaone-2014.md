Some of the JavaOne 2014 talks were published at [Parleys](https://www.parleys.com/home) and I hope that a lot of other talks will follow. Thankfully some of the published talks are very good JavaFX related talks and I will post a list of all JavaFX talks. Once new talks will be posted at Parleys I will update the list.
