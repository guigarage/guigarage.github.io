This year I will give 2 talks at JavaOne. For a short preview of the talks we recorded some videos in that I give a short overview about its topics.

The first talk will be "JavaFX Enterprise 2.0" that is a successor of my last year "JavaFX Enterprise" talk. I will do the talk together with [Alexander Casall](https://twitter.com/sialcasa). Here is the video:

The second talk will be about the JavaOne Voting Machine. For JavaOne we (Canoo) created a JavaFX based embedded device to vote all the JavaOne sessions that you will attend directly after the talk.

If you will attend JavaOne you will find Voting Machines in every room. If you can't attend the conference I will write a post about the technology and the UI later. I will do the talk together with [Gerrit Grunwald](https://twitter.com/hanSolo_) and [Michael Heinrichs](https://twitter.com/net0pyr). Here is the video:

Between the talks I would love to talk with you about the [Dolphin Platform]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-10-04-dolphin-platform-a-sneak-peek %}) :)

In addition I will use this post to promote another talk about Functional Reactive Programing with UI toolkits by Michael Heinrichs. We created a short video for this talk, too.
