For [JavaLand 2015](https://www.javaland.eu/de/home/) we (Canoo) created some small reference cards for technologies that we are currently involved in or committed
to.

For the conference the printed the reference cards in high quality and today I thought that the content might be interested for all the developers that didn't attend the conference :) Therefore I uploaded the reference cards as pdf files to my blog. The cards are written in German.

* [Web Components Reference Card](/assets/downloads/ref-cards/canoo-webcomponents.pdf)
* [JavaFX Reference Card](/assets/downloads/ref-cards/canoo-javafx.pdf)
* [Open Dolphin Reference Card](/assets/downloads/ref-cards/canoo-od.pdf)

Hopefully we will add a [Dolphin Platform](https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform) RefCard for JavaLand 2016 :)
