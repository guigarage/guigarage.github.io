JavaOne is coming closer and closer. On the one hand I can't wait to be there but on the other hand I need to finish all my talks in only a few days :fearful:

At canoo we prepared a short overview of all our talks. If you fare interested in a preview of the canoo talks watch them.

In addition a interview with me about JavaOne and my current work was posted at [FX Experience](tp://fxexperience.com/2014/09/javaone-interviews-hendrik-ebbers/) and another overview about my talks can be found at the [JavaOne blog](https://blogs.oracle.com/javaone/entry/javaone_speaker_henrick_ebbers).

I think that I won't have time to add an additional blog post before JavaOne. But at the moment I have several post finished that describes new APIs and tricks that I want to show at JavaOne :) I you can't be there you should stay tuned and wait for these posts.
