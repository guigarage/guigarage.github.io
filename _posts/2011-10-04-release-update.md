While the last days were a little bit quite here I worked a lot on my APIs. The gestures-wrapper API is available in Version 0.2 and synced to [maven central repository](http://search.maven.org/). The next Version of the JGrid will synced to central repository too. Actually you can find the JGrid 0.3-Snapshot @Â [https://oss.sonatype.org](https://oss.sonatype.org). I'm confident to release Version 0.3 of the JGrid next week. There is only one open bug left at the moment. The release will support multiselection and key controls. In addition the UI-Classes are completely refactored.
