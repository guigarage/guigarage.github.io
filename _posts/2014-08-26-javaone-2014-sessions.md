Uh, as a featured speaker I will give a lot sessions this year at JavaOne. This is the main reason why I found no time to blog about JavaFX the last weeks ;)

If you will attend JavaOne I will be happy to see you at one of my session:

* Enterprise JavaFX (Hilton - Plaza A, 9/29/14, 16:00 - 17:00)
* DataFX: From External Data to a UI Flow and Back (Hilton - Plaza B, 9/29/14, 11:00 - 12:00)
* Smart UIs for Mobile and Embedded in JavaFX (Hilton - Plaza B, 9/30/14, 19:00 - 19:45)
* The JavaFX Community and Ecosystem (Hilton - Plaza B, 9/30/14, 11:00 - 12:00)
* Extreme GUI Makeover (Hilton - Yosemite B/C, 10/1/14, 13:00 - 14:00)
* Test-Driven Development with JavaFX (Hilton - Plaza B, 10/1/14, 11:30 - 12:30)

Maybe I can organize some ["Mastering JavaFX 8 Controls" books]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/mastering-javafx-controls.md %}) for the audience :)
