Starting with [version 0.7]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-12-16-dolphin-platform-0-7-has-been-released %}) the Dolphin Platform JavaScript and [Polymer]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-10-23-dolphin-platform-web-frontends-with-polymer %}) API has been released. Now you can easily create desktop, mobile and web clients for your application by using the same controller and presentation model. You only need to change the thin view layer. The Dolphin Platform repository at GitHub already contains a small client server application with a JavaFX based client and a Polymer client. In addition the example contains a [Spring Boot](http://spring boot tutorial) and a [KumuluzEE](http://www.kumuluz.com) server. By doing so you can select the environment that fits perfectly to your needs. You can find there project [here](https://github.com/canoo/dolphin-platform/tree/46bf958b5f50a9d9517ca03176dfda40f2a0801c/todo-example). A short description about the Polymer client API can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-10-23-dolphin-platform-web-frontends-with-polymer %}).
