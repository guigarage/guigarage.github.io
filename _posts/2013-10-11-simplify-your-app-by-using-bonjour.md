If you are writing a JavaFX application that will connect to different servers in a local network you should have a look at Bonjour / ZeroConf. This technology is for example used by Apple to implement Airplay. If you want to stream pictures from your iPhone to a appleTV you need no configuration. The iPhone will find the picture service in the local network automatically. This can be very helpful for home automation and other embedded systems. I prepared some slides for a Bonjour talk at Java User Group Dortmund, Germany and uploaded them to our [slide archive at guigarage]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/talks.md %}).
