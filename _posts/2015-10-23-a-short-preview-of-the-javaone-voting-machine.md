Today I want to give a short preview of the JavaOne Voting Machine that is build for this year JavaOne as a cooperative project by Canoo and Oracle.

Voting Machine devices will be placed in every room at JavaOne. By doing so attendees can directly vote for each session and the voting results will be shown on a central leaderboard.

Currently [Michael Heinrichs](https://twitter.com/net0pyr) and I manufacture and test all the devices in Silicon Valley and hope to have all of them finished with the beginning of the next week :)
