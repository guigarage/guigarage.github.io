The JUG Switzerland has announced an event with some talks of the JavaOne 2015. You can find all information [here](http://www.jug.ch/html/events/2015/javaone_after_event.html). I'm happy that 2 of the 5 talks are JavaFX / UI related. If you havenâ€™t had the change to attend JavaOne and live near Zurich you should visit this event.
