JavaFX is the new UI API for Java Desktop applications and since summer it is part of Java 7. So every new Java Runtime is shipped with JavaFX. I think it's the perfect time to play with this great API and learn how to create cool applications with a better user experience than ever before.

To learn JavaFX I started the [gridFX]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-11-14-gridfx-is-hosted-at-github %}) project that provide a grid based control for JavaFX. While programming this control I learned a lot about JavaFX and all the different included APIs.

By doing so it was sometimes hard to understand some of the paradigms that are used in JavaFX. It took a lot of research and the help of some guys ([Gerrit Grunwald](http://harmoniccode.blogspot.de), [Jonathan Giles](http://jonathangiles.net)) to understand this approaches and use them to create a better code and integration to the given APIs. After understanding all this stuff I can say that JavaFX is a really powerful API with a lot of potential.

After all I think that the learning curve for JavaFX is much different to the one for swing. The basics are currently hard to understand and learn but ones you decode them everything is so much easier.

I want to use my blog to provide some basic tutorials about the different APIs and technics of JavaFX. All this tutorials are based on [demos]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-11-14-playing-with-gridfx-and-itunes-webservices %}) that will use gridFX. Hope you like them.
