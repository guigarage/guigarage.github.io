As I mentioned [last week]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-08-26-javaone-2014-sessions %}) I will give 6 talks at [JavaOne](https://www.oracle.com/javaone/) this year. To get a better overview of this talks I recorded a short video in that I introduce the talks and show a short preview of some JavaFX demos:
