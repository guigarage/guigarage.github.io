Today I start a new version of my blog. Next to migrating all the posts to this new version I will add some new content. Since JavaFX will still be a very important part of GuiGarage I will add some new categories for web frontends and UI/UX in general. I hope to finalize everything in the next 2 weeks.

I something get's broken or a link isn't working for you please add a comment :)
