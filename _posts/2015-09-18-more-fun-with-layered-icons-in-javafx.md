2 days ago [I showed the first demo]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-09-16-layered-images-and-icons-with-javafx %}) of my layered icon component for JavaFX that copies the visualization of the new AppleTV icons. Yesterday evening I created some cool new layered icons based on this technology and recorded a video of the examples (I describe the effects and some first techniques in the movie). Hopefully I find some time to describe the used technology in detail. Since this will be a longer post it sadly needs some time...
