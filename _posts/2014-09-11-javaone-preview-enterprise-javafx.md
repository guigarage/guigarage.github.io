Today I want to give a short preview of one of my talks at JavaOne: [Enterprise JavaFX](https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2341).

In this talk I will discuss different problems in enterprise development with JavaFX. The talk will introduce some solutions and best practice how to handle background threads, call web services or make use of Java EE specifications like dependency injection. In addition some frameworks will be shown.

If you are in this topics meet me at Java One :)

Venue / Room: Hilton - Plaza A
Date and Time: 9/29/14, 16:00 - 17:00

Because I think a good talk must contain cool demos, I created some examples especially for my talks. Today I will introduce one of them with a short video. The video shows how you can login with Twitter in JavaFX. You can use this as an alternative workflow for users to login or register in your application. If you want to know how this is done you should visit my "Enterprise JavaFX" talk :)
