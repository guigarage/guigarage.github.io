The last weeks my top priority was [JavaFX]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-11-17-custom-ui-controls-with-javafx-part-1 %}) and [GridFX]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-11-29-gridfx-is-moving-forward %}). But this doesn't mean that [Vagrant-Binding]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-11-01-introducing-vagrant-binding %}) stands still. Currently I'm working on [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) support for the API. So you can choose between [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com) and Chef as provisioner. I have some great plans for the future and I think that [Vagrants future and the founding of HashiCorp](http://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-hashicorp.html) will be very positive for Vagrant-Binding. I was always thinking how to add [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com) as a second provider next to [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org). I hope that Vagrants further development will provide exactly this features :)

I am, by the way, not a Chef expert. So maybe anyone out there wants to help me with the Chef integration and provides some Chef projects that covers all the support Chef features in Vagrant. It would be a superb help for a full functional and great API.
