Thanks to [Jonathan Giles](http://jonathangiles.net/blog/) and Jasper Potts who integrated guigarage.com in their [JavaOne](http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html) slides. It's just a picture but I'm very proud :)

Download the slides [here](https://oracleus.wingateweb.com/published/oracleus2011/sessions/24140/S24140_2556650.pdf) and scroll to page 21... (and then take a look at the complete presentation. It's worth reading.)
