Canoo had [16 sessions at JavaOne](https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/search.ww?eventRef=javaone#loadSearch-event=null&searchPhrase=Koenig+Heinrichs+Ebbers+Ruiz+Almiray&searchType=session&tc=0&sortBy=&p=&i(10009)=10111) this year. In this sessions we discussed different topics like enterprise architecture, testing, open dolphin or usability design. For all the developers that can't attend JavaOne Canoo has a nice offer:

We selected some of our talks and will give them again in Basel. There will be two open events with different talks the next weeks:

* JavaOne event with Michael Heinrichs, Andres Almiray and Ixchel Ruiz
* JavaOne event with Hendrik Ebbers

If you are interested in Java and live near Basel you should attend one of these events.
